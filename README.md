# GoSystemOfEquation
## Created a RESTFul interface in GoLang which takes two linear equations ( for example ax + by = c , dx + ey = f ) and solves for values x and y
### Using Advanced Linear Algebra we can reduce the time complexity to O(1)
### convert the system of equations into an augmented Matrix A*x = b
### Then solve for x, using A's inverse, x = A<sup>-1</sup>*b
